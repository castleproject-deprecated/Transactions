        <member name="T:Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.Lifestyles.PerTopTransactionLifestyleManager">
            <summary>
            A lifestyle manager for every top transaction in the current call context. This lifestyle is great
            for components that are thread-safe and need to monitor/handle items in both the current thread
            and any forked method invocations. It's also favoring memory if your application is single threaded,
            as there's no need to create a new component every sub-transaction. (this refers to the Fork=true option
            on the TransactionAttribute).

        <member name="T:Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.Lifestyles.PerTransactionLifestyleManagerBase">
            <summary>
            This lifestyle manager is responsible for disposing components
            at the same time as the transaction is completed, i.e. the transction
            either Aborts, becomes InDoubt or Commits.

        <member name="T:Castle.Facilities.AutoTx.Lifestyles.PerTransactionLifestyleManager">
            <summary>
            A lifestyle manager that resolves a fresh instance for every transaction. In my opinion, this 
            is the most semantically correct option of the two per-transaction lifestyle managers: it's possible
            to audit your code to verify that sub-sequent calls to services don't start new transactions on their own.
            With this lifestyle, code executing in other threads work as expected, as no instances are shared accross these
            threads (this refers to the Fork=true option on the TransactionAttribute).
